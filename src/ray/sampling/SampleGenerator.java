/**
 * A sample generator is responsible for generating random (or quasi-random) samples 
 * on a multidimensional domain.  It exists to keep track of stratified sampling
 * patterns.
 * 
 * The idea is that a sample pattern is a set of points in a multidimensional space,
 * which are in some way "nicely distributed" over some dimensions.  In principle, the
 * number of dimensions needs to be unlimited, because rendering often includes
 * recursive processes that don't terminate deterministically.  We can think of the 
 * samples as being like a 2D table: each row is a sample, and each column is a
 * dimension in the problem.  For example, the columns might correspond to subpixel
 * position, shadow ray direction, reflected ray direction, etc.  To get the benefits 
 * of stratified patterns, all the values in a particular column need to be related
 * to one another.  The caller is free to assign any desired meaning to the columns,
 * and there's not even any requirement that they be used in order.
 * 
 * A sample generator internally maintains whatever state is required to be able to 
 * generate the entries in this table.  It generally won't need to generate any
 * samples in a particular column until the first time one is called for.  A pattern 
 * is assumed to have a fixed number of samples.
